### NLP Extractions Prerequisits
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_lg")

review = nlp("Food here is really good, as are the views of the lake and the ambience. Our waiter gave us good service but it wasnâ€™t always easy to get their attention. Nevertheless I throughly enjoyed our evening here. N.B. if you are driving, it may take you a while to find a parking space (as it gets really busy on weekends) and so would advise taking a taxi or travelling by public transport instead.")
### POS, Dependencies, NER
for token in review:
    print(token)
    
for sentence in review.sents:
    print(sentence)
    sentence_document = nlp(sentence.text)
    for token in sentence_document:
        print(token.text, " POS: ", token.pos_, " DEP: ", token.dep_, " ENT: ", token.ent_type_)
### Topic Detection
import spacy.displacy as displacy
displacy.render(review)
topics = {}

for sentence in review.sents:
    sentence_document = nlp(sentence.text)
    for token in sentence_document:
        if token.pos_ == "NOUN" and (token.dep_ == "nsubj" or token.dep_ == "pobj"):
            topics[token] = sentence_document.text

print(topics)
### Sentiment Analysis
from textblob import TextBlob

sentiment = TextBlob("The food was awful").sentiment

print(sentiment)

for topic, sentence in topics.items():
    sentiment = TextBlob(sentence).sentiment
    print(topic, ": ", sentiment.polarity)
### Question Answering

Generate Question / Answers from an existing Text
text = nlp("Keanu bought a house in Locarno. Henry didn't like that.")
question_words = {
    "PERSON": "who",
    "GPE": "where"
}

for sentence in text.sents:
    sentence_document = nlp(sentence.text)
    for token in sentence_document:
        if token.ent_type_ is not "":
            question_word = question_words[token.ent_type_]
            if question_word is not None:
                question = sentence_document.text.replace(token.text, question_word)
                answer = token.text
                print(token.text, ": ", token.ent_type_)
                print(question, "? ", answer)
